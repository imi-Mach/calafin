# Financial Calculations App

**Update**: I am looking to re-work this project using the ASP.net Core framework. Will migrate work to here once I have finished on the private repo.

This python code is how I interpret my expenses on a montly basis.

To:

1. understand what how much I am spending to what I am expecting.
2. assign a score to how well I did on a monthly basis.
3. predict expences in the future.
4. segmentation tool for seasonal spending.# calafin
